# Heartisan: ECG Data Monitoring and Arrhythmia Prediction through continuous learning from patient data.

An end to end system to monitor individual patient's ECG results and predict Arrhythmia through continuous learning from patient data

**Abstract**<br />
Remote health monitoring system is one of the most crucial medical innovations. Especially the importance of such systems was seen during the covid pandemic. With cardiac disease being the leading cause of death worldwide, the importance of remote ECG monitoring and early heart disease prediction systems is rising day by day. Here, a web based system is proposed that could enable real-time monitoring of individuals with chronic conditions as well as aid in early arrhythmia prediction using machine learning methods. A portable ECG machine can be easily connected to the user-friendly web based application. The app allows patients to effortlessly record, store, and monitor ECG graphs as well as obtain arrhythmia predictions. It comes with a custom graph viewing mode. Patients can share their data with any doctor, any time. This will cut down on the distance between patients and doctors significantly. Additionally, it provides a semi-supervised system for doctor verified arrhythmia data collection and autonomous model upgradation. The system is hoped to bring cardiac patients and doctors closer as well as support patients with an advanced AI system for early disease prediction. It is also expected that such a system will contribute in building novel arrhythmia datasets for researchers.
